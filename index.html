                            This site is dedicated to <strong>alpacas</strong> It is similar to, and often confused with, the llama. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. Alpacas can sometimes be aggressive, but they can also be very gentle, intelligent, and extremely observant. For the most part, alpacas are very quiet, but male alpacas are more energetic when they get involved in fighting with other alpacas. <br> <em>If you want to learn more, join us!</em>

            “You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive, but you have shown me... that's impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those, that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist...I'm thankful. Because now I know what I must do. I will shred this universe down to its last atom and then, with the Stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life. That knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.”        </div>
